# Multiverse Workshop
In this project folder, you can find the codes to conduct the example multiverse analysis presented in the SAS Workshop "Applying Multiverse Analyses Across the Research Pipeline"

In this example I have used open data from "Mental Health and Social Contact During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study" (Eiko I. Fried & Sacha Epskamp) available on the (osf https://osf.io/mvdpe/).

In this analysis, I provide a demonstration of how to use Copilot to create multiple datasets for a multiverse based on equally justifiable decisions. 

The code is in the main folder under Multiverse analysis.r 

In the code there is a direct link to downloading the data from osf.

The slides of the presentation provide the background on the method and the decisions in the dataset.
